# ReaperFX
A collection of JSFX plugins I made for the REAPER DAW. 
Use at your own risk ;-)

**DrumSat**: a simple but usefull saturation plugin made for drums. 4 diff. algorithms, peak style auto gain, and 4x oversampling. There is also a hi and low parse, NOTE! they do not restrict the frequencies coming through but they restrict which frequencies are saturated. 

**DrumSat_TX**: same as DrumSat but with presence filter and a transformer emulation

**AnaMaker**: Well, I decided to rename the thing as it kind of evolved into a more analog channel emulation. This has all the others have, plus a M/S slider which basically can bring back the width lost when saturating the signal. Of course this only has effect on stereo signals.

**AnaTape**: Just a simple tape emulator for bus saturation and analog vibe.
